summary: Logout a user
operationId: AuthController_logout
description: |
  The logout endpoint is a logout mechanism that destroys the 
    token that was issued during previous authentication.

  When the user clicks the log out button, he makes a request for a
    URL/api/auth/logout with a valid token in the Authorization header.
    The server checks the validity of the token, if the token is valid,
    then the token is deleted and the user returns to the login page.
    If the token is not valid, the server returns the 401 status and
    reports that the token is invalid.
