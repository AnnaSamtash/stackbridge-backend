  Create reset jwt and send email with link to reset password page

  When the user presses the password reset button, he makes a request
    to URL/api/auth/send-reset-email with a registered email. The server
    checks the presence of the user in the system using the transmitted
    email, if it finds that it forms a jwt token and transfers it to the link
    to reset password page in the email.If a user with such mail is not found,
    then the server returns this result in an error with the status 404th.
